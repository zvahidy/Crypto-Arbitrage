# Crypto-Arbitrage# Loan_Qualifier

I currently work as an analyst at a high-tech investment firm and the vice president is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Simultaneous price dislocations across Bitcoin trades can create oppotunities to buy and sell and make profits. So by using pandas to analyze data, will reveal the potential profits in those markets.

I will be sorting through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase to locate arbitrage opportunities that may exist for Bitcoin. .
